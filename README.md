# C-secure
Csecure is a child tracking system. So whenever a child boards a bus parent of that child is motified that their child has boarded the bus. At the same time school will also get notified that the child as well as bus has left the school. So for the same we have created three apps 1. Busdriver Module 2. Parent Module 3. Admin module and one raspberry pi interfacing module.
